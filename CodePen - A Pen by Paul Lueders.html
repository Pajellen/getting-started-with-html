<h1>Observations and Short Notes</h1>

<strong>Web Basics</strong>
<p>The Internet has multiple elements, the Web being the most visible one to the public eye. The web is a huge interwoven web of servers and cilents constantly communicating with eachother using the HTTP protocol or Hypertext Transfer Protocol expanded out,
  to create the largest network in the world. When a client is on the web, they are sending HTTP requests to serves to receive documents and data. Most of that data is presented in a web language called HTML, which is the key language we will be learning
  in this lesson.

<strong>HTML</strong>
<p>HTML is a very useful language for the Web, it provides a very simple and easy to learn computer-readable language that can allow the meshing of Text and Multimedia content with markup tags that can change the look of the website.

  video</a> provides a more indepth review of HTML

<strong>Tags and Elements</strong>
<p>HTML documents are made up of various elements, which are expressed with tags to manipulate the view of the content created by the creator. A few examples of HTML Tags are:
  <UL>
    <li> b Tag = Bold, inline
      <li> em Tag = Emphasis (italics), inline Lack of end tag will make entire text after opening tag be applied Attributes in tags usually are values
        <li> a Tag = Anchor (usually a link), inline
          <UL>
            <li> href attribute = specifies URL
          </ul>
          <li> img Tag = Images, inline
            <UL>
              <li> src = URL
                <li> alt = Text (required, shows when you mouse over link)
                  <li> Void Tag, no closing tag needed
            </ul>
            <li> br Tag = Line break (Void Tag), inline
              <li> p Tag = Paragraph (Requires end tag), block
  </ul>
</p>

<strong>Inline or Block elements</strong>
<p>
  Inline = Tag that keeps in line with document
  <br> Block = Tag that makes an invisible box with internal formatting
</p>

<strong>Computer Strengths and limitations</strong>
<p>Computers have various strengths and weaknesses, one major strength to computers is their unerring and unflinching nature to follow instructions. However this exact strength can be a weakness as well, computers follow instructions even if those instructions
  are clearly wrong or misinterpreted. Programmers are challenged with this black and white dogma each time they try to develop code to be used, but with a little finess it can be harnessesed to its great potential
